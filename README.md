# Sleep Minting

A new NFT scam here's how it works.

A malicious user calls a mint function on the smart contract.
The contract mints the NFT to a well-known wallet and in the same transaction transfers it to the caller.
Giving an illusion that the wallet sold the NFT to the malicious user.

Looks very legit on Opensea
C6B056 never minted this NFT though on Opensea it displays as if it transferred it to A5357E.

Remember, NFT is just code.

Fortunately, someone on the FortaNetwork is also running a bot to detect these NFTs.
Not sure how accurate it is though.
